# this sctipt simply invokes imbl-ui.py and cleans left over in /dev/shm/
# if required. May need it if the UI exits sub-normally, skipping clean-up step.

# Files still may stay in memory if this script is killed directly, but
#   a) users are unlikely to execute it directly, but rather via the *.desktop icon
#      and furher operate only the UI and
#   b) we will have at least $rmlist file left to see the worst has happened.
